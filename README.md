# Afficom

You can invite the bot [with this invite link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=592661179688812545&permissions=8&scope=bot)

Afficom is a Discord bot I decided to make for the [Discord Hack Week](https://discord.gg/hackweek). Right now it only has advanced, Tensorflow powered automoderation system, but maybe I'll add more features as the time goes on.

## Setting up the bot
1. Create your app and get the config from the [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
2. Clone the repo onto your computer
3. Execute `npm install`
4. Fill in the token (and optionally change the prefix) in config.json (also change the name from config.json.EXAMPLE to config.json)
5. Execute `node main.js`

The bot should be up and running

You can simply invite the bot by clicking [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=592661179688812545&permissions=8&scope=bot).

Once you add the bot to your server, it should start working immadiately. A new channel called *#afficom-filtered-messages* should be created and the bot should send a message to it. If it did, it means that the bot is working and is looking for toxic messages. If, for some reason it didn't, please notify me in [the support server](https://discord.gg/RqqZKAg) and create a channel called *#afficom-filtered-messages* (the name is important!) by yourself (the bot must have a read and write access to the channel!)
